1. How does flow control work?

Conditionals and loops alter the flow of a Ruby program. 
When the program is run, the statements are executed from the top of the source file to the bottom. One by one.


2. Can you come up with another example of flow control that you could have used here?

 if number % 5 == 0
      'buzz'


3. How does the % operator work?

% operation find the remainder of division of one number by another

4. What is the difference between = and ==?

== :Comparison operator: Checks if the value of two operands are equal or not, if yes then condition becomes true.
(a == b) is not true.
(a == a) is true.

= :Assignment Operator: Assigns values from right side operands to left side operand.
c = a + b , will assign the value of a + b into c
